In comparison, other issues like rising interest rates, revenue, and supply chain issues remain second-tier worries.\n\nTopics/\nSmall Business/\n\n\n Thaddeus Swanek \nSenior Writer and Editor, Strategic Communications, U.S. Chamber of Commerce\nPublished\nJuly 10, 2023\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation remains the top concern for a majority of small business owners (54%), according to a recent poll by the Chamber. In comparison, other issues like rising interest rates, revenue, and supply chain issues remain second-tier worries.\nHere are the top concerns of America’s small businesses according to the latest MetLife and U.S. Chamber Small Business Index.\nInflation\nA majority (54%) of small business owners cite inflation as a top concern. In fact, inflation is the top concern for small businesses regardless of region, number of employees, or sector.\nThis is also the sixth consecutive quarter that inflation has topped the list of challenges small businesses see, and consistent with findings in Q1 2023 (54%). No other concern comes close.\n\n“I would say inflation is still going up,” says Hrag Kalebjian, owner of Henry’s House of Coffee in San Francisco, earlier this year. “Case in point is our cost of coffee, labor, and overhead like gas and electricity. ... The challenge is keeping up with these costs and constantly raising my prices. It seems as though I can't keep up.”\nHonoring America's Top Small Businesses\n #### The Results Are In.

This is up considerably from last quarter (16%) and sixteen points higher than last year (7% in Q1 2022).\nRising interest rates are causing some in the small business community to say they are seeking out financing more earnestly. Three in four small businesses (76%) say that rising interest rates are limiting their ability to raise capital or financing for their business. The spike is also stunting growth, as 50% of small businesses report that they have delayed plans to grow their business due to rising interest rates.\n“Tightening in both credit and private equity markets is creating challenges for many small business owners,” says Stephanie Sims, Founder of Finance-Ability in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Rising interest rates make it more challenging for some entrepreneurs to qualify for financing, although I have seen several loan guarantee programs step up to assist some of these borrowers in securing funding.”\nRevenue\nThe percentage of all small businesses reporting revenue as a top challenge fell from 22% earlier this year (Q1 2023) to 20% this quarter.\nDespite downbeat current views, small businesses have record expectations for revenue. A full 71% of small businesses say they expect next year’s revenue to increase, up seven points from the previous quarter.\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nConsistent with the previous quarter, 23% of small businesses said supply chain issues are a top concern.\nSmall businesses’ concern over supply chain issues reached a peak in Q2 2022, with 28% reporting it as a top concern. Since then, it has generally trended downward, with 26% in Q3 2022, 20% in Q4 2022, and 21% last quarter, saying supply chains are a top concern.\n\nThe Q2 2023 SBI survey was conducted between May 8-24, 2023.

The third quarter's MetLife and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index recorded record-breaking optimism among small business owners about the future.\nHowever, concerns remain about the economy, the labor market, and managing supply chain issues related to global events. These are the five challenges keeping small business owners up at night.\nInflation\nRising inflation isn’t just an issue for consumers — it’s one of the biggest challenges for small business owners, too. Inflation disproportionately impacts small businesses, which have less leverage when it comes to buying power compared to their larger competitors.\n“Nearly 80% of small business owners say their expenses have increased by 6% or more, according to Chase’s Midyear Business Leaders Outlook,” reported Yahoo Finance. “In response to higher costs, raising prices on products and cutting expenses top the list of ways entrepreneurs are trying to limit the effects.”\nFor many small businesses, inflation has eroded already thin profit margins. Mama Moore's Gourmet Popcorn Founder Debra Moore told Yahoo Finance that inflation has forced her to pay 200% more for some of her essential ingredients. Many are turning to additional financing to fuel growth and stay operational.\nAccess to credit\nSpeaking of additional financing: A survey by Goldman Sachs found that more than three-quarters of small business owners are concerned about their ability to access capital. “Just a year ago, 77% of respondents said they were confident about their access capital. Now the tables have turned, with the same percentage citing concern,” reported the investment bank.\nThe challenge of accessing credit is tied to rising interest rates as well as banking stress resulting from regional bank closures. Small businesses disproportionately rely on smaller banks—and this year, the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank caused many small businesses to lose their source of funding. The closure of these regional banks put stress on the entire banking system, so even small business ventures that didn’t patronize Silicon Valley or Signature banks have felt the impact of this turmoil.\n[Read more: 7 Small Business Financing Trends to Watch in 2023]\nIt’s harder for mom-and-pop retailers to compete for workers against Fortune-500 counterparts that advertise attractive pay and benefits.\nMolly Burke, Capterra\nRising interest rates\nCompared to last quarter, small businesses are less concerned about interest rate hikes, according to the Small Business Index. Nevertheless, rising interest rates remain a top challenge for small businesses today.\n“Rising interest rates are causing some in the small business community to say they are seeking out financing more earnestly,” wrote Thaddeus Swanek, Senior Writer and Editor at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “Three in four small businesses (76%) say that rising interest rates are limiting their ability to raise capital or financing for their business. The spike is also stunting growth, as 50% of small businesses report that they have delayed plans to grow their business due to rising interest rates.”\nInflation, rising interest rates, and access to credit are three facets of the same problem: Small businesses are struggling to get the fuel they need to grow sustainably. It’s a challenge, however, that many feel will ease going into the new year.\nHiring and employee retention\nThese economic pressures are making it difficult for small businesses to keep their best talent onboard and continue attracting new hires. The Q3 2023 Small Business Index found that “[o]ver half of small businesses (56%) say it is challenging to keep up with their employees’ salary expectations or demands.”\nLikewise, companies that are trying to hire are struggling to fill open roles. A CNN Business survey reported that small business owners had trouble filling job openings, a consistent challenge that’s been historically very high since the beginning of the year.\n“SMBs, which employ only up to 1,000 people, typically have much smaller margins than big-box companies,” explained Capterra. “It’s harder for mom-and-pop retailers to compete for workers against Fortune-500 counterparts that advertise attractive pay and benefits, let alone weather the costs of attrition in the first place.”\nSupply chain disruptions\nFinally, supply chain delays that originated from the pandemic continue to be a challenge for some small businesses. In 2023, 23% of small businesses said supply chain issues are a top concern.\nWhile larger enterprises have found ways to work around blockages in their supply chains, small business owners don’t have the same financial flexibility. Experts say that economic conditions, rising inflation, and global tensions in places like Ukraine and China will continue to create challenges for small business supply chains through to 2024.\nSmall businesses that have switched to domestic suppliers have already found relief. “Though they may charge more than their overseas counterparts, you may be able to eliminate most of the logistical issues that come from shipping products halfway around the world and actually get your products,” reported Nav.\n[Read more: Inventory Management Challenges and Tips for Small Businesses]\nCO— aims to bring you inspiration from leading respected experts.\nHowever, before making any business decision, you should consult a\nprofessional who can advise you based on your individual situation.\nCO—is committed to helping you start, run and grow your small business.

                "raw_content": "1,000 UK Business Owners Reveal Their Top Challenges for 2023\nOwning a business is always challenging. But for some UK employers, the cultural and economic challenges of the past 12 months have been particularly demanding, with high inflation rates, low consumer spending and rapidly advancing technologies like AI significantly changing the commercial landscape.\nTo fully understand what lies ahead, we surveyed over 1,000 UK SME owners and senior leaders across dozens of industries. What do they see as the key business challenges for 2023 — and what does it tell us about the future?\nWhat is the number 1 challenge businesses said they face in 2023? \nWhen asked to state the biggest challenge they faced in 2023, the top answer from business owners was “Financial Challenges” with nearly half of the vote (46%). Less than 1 in 10 (9%) put this as their top challenge in last year’s survey.\n1 in 10 (11%) of business cited environmental sustainability challenges as their biggest concern for the next 12 months. This has dropped by half since 2022, when 22% of businesses said it was their biggest challenge.\nTalent and people is at 9%, up from 7% in 2022, amid a year in which salary demands from workers are increasing and businesses have struggled to keep up.\nFewer business owners listed societal changes as their top concern than they did last year. While more than 1 in 10 (11%) reported worries about social change in 2022, it almost halved to 1 in 20 (6%) in 2023.\nThe top 10 concerns for small businesses in 2023\nTop 10 concerns for businesses in 2022\nThe most commonly reported concern for UK SMEs was staying profitable. 2 in 5 businesses are worried about pricing and profitability (42%). Almost as many businesses said they were concerned that consumers were less willing to spend money than they were a year ago (35%).\nThird was the price of things like rent and energy (30%), a new entry to the top 10 list for 2023. This follows from the record energy price rises in late 2022 and the recent announcement that the Bank of England is moving to a 15-year-high 5.25% interest rate in order to combat inflation, driving up the prices of commercial mortgages.\nAdvancements in AI were cited as a concern for 1 in 5 (21%) businesses, closely followed by rising online fraud (20%), both new in the top 10 this year. Cybersecurity also crept up the priority list since last year, moving from 9th in 2022 to 7th in 2023.\nUnderstandably, 2022’s concerns about further lockdowns (1) and coronavirus regulations (8) have dropped out of the top 10 completely in 2023.\nBusiness outlooks for 2023\nThere was a significant increase in companies expecting to maintain their current performance in 2023. It nearly tripled to 32%, from just 13% in 2022.\nHowever, 1 in 5 (20%) business owners and leaders expect their companies to struggle in the next 12 months, double the rate in 2022 (10%). Additionally, less than a quarter (24%) of business owners expected their companies to grow in the next 12 months, down from 32% in 2022.\nPerhaps encouragingly, the number of businesses expecting to close has dropped by half in 2023 to 5%, down from 10% in 2022. Business owners expecting to sell in 2023 (4%) is only about a third of that in 2022 (12%).\n \nWhat the data tells us\nJodie Wilkinson, Head of Strategic Partnerships, at takepayments says: “It’s perhaps unsurprising that financial pressures have rocketed to the top of the list of concerns for businesses in 2023.”\n“The high inflation we’ve experienced over the last twelve months is putting pressure on business leaders to both keep consumer-facing prices competitive, while also addressing salary demands and increasing supplier rates.”\n“Rising costs can put pressure on businesses' margins, making it crucial for them to optimise pricing strategies and explore cost-cutting measures to maintain profitability.”\n“The drop in concern for environmental factors may be a knock-on effect of the cost of living crisis, with SMEs shifting their focus to address more immediate financial challenges. However, we hope that companies remain mindful of their environmental responsibilities in the long term.”\n“The fact that so many more businesses anticipate that they’ll struggle this year emphasises the need for proactive measures to overcome challenges. As a digital payments provider, we believe it’s crucial to understand and address these concerns by offering innovative solutions that can help businesses streamline their financial operations and boost efficiency.”\nMethodology\nTo collect this data, takepayments surveyed 1,000 UK-based business owners, directors and leaders between 27th July and 1st August 2023. Users were screened prior to their responses and each answer was stratified to ensure maximum accuracy.

An informal survey of CEOs, advertising, and other executives and experts yielded what they thought are the most significant dangers businesses will face this year.\nRecession\n“The biggest and most obvious threat to companies and organizations in 2023 is the global rise of inflation and subsequent economic downturn,” Richard Osborne, founder and CEO of UK Business Forums, said via email.\n“Recession is the word on everyone’s lips heading into 2023. While profiting during a period of high inflation isn’t completely impossible, it’s far from ideal when consumers have less purchasing power. The value of a currency is only as high as the number of goods or services that one unit of money can buy,” he noted.\nInterest Rates\nRed arrow symbol forming a line graph over a graph paper background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] copy space.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023\n“The raised interest rates will continue to burn working capital for businesses across the economy,” Salvatore Stile, chairman of Alba Wheels Up International, an international shipping and customs clearance company, said via email.\n“Because retailers are concerned with consumer demand, they will likely be more cautious in purchasing inventory to prevent over-supply in the retail market,” he predicted.\n“This will burden small and medium-sized companies, who will have to be de facto warehouses for the retailers, as they hold products for more extended periods. We expect freight rates to reduce in 2023 when compared to 2022, as demand for overseas goods has reduced across the board,” Stile observed.\nStaff shortage grunge rubber stamp on white background, vector illustration\nLabor Shortage\n“Today's labor shortage and skills gap challenges will continue into 2023 as HR teams bolster their recruitment and retention efforts to reach and retain talent across all levels of the organization,” Veena Bricker, chief people officer of data center provider Flexential, said via email.\n“HR teams will explore more diverse avenues, job boards and organizations to find the shared skills needed to support the business, dipping into all major and secondary markets. We'll also see attrition measurement practices increase as organizations will be held accountable for their own diversity spectrum—something proved invaluable to existing and prospective talent,” she predicted.\nRapidly Changing Market Trends\nRisks and threats can be forerunners to crisis situations for companies and organizations. An ... [+] informal survey of CEOs, advertising, and other executives and experts yielded what they thought were the most significant dangers businesses will face this year.\n“The biggest risk companies have in 2023 is that market trends change much more rapidly than they used to, and being slow to react can be detrimental,” Isabella Sun, CEO of Short Story, a San Francisco-based clothing retailer, said via email.\nThis year “will require companies to develop an ultra-fast reaction time to macro movements and to use their data and technology to make rapid decisions…organizations need to get maximum utility from the technology and data they have to turbocharge their reaction time,” she advised.\nSupply Chains\n“We’re still far from solving issues related to global supply chains. And that’s a problem that will continue to plague businesses as we head into 2023,” Bob Rogers, CEO of Oii.ai, a data science company specializing in supply chain modeling, said via email\n“What people don’t realize is that most supply chains are configured manually. That means there’s a human adjusting the parameters every time an interruption occurs. But that’s a tedious task that people are simply too inefficient to do successfully on a large scale,” he commented.\nCybersecurity\nAn abstract design of a terminal display, warning about a cyber attack. Multiple rows of hexadecimal ... [+] code are interrupted by red glowing warnings and single character exclamation marks. The image can represent a variety of threats in the digital world: data theft, data leak, security breach, intrusion, anti-virus failure, etc...\n“Cybersecurity is a hot button for business executives in 2023. This burden is no longer limited to the responsibility of just the IT department,” Howard Globus, founder and CEO of IT on Demand, said via email.\nHe noted that, “In a 2022 report, Gartner research shows that 88% of board regard cybersecurity as a business risk rather that solely a technical IT problem. The same report says that by 2026, at least 50% of C-Level executives will have performance requirements related to cybersecurity risk built into their employment contracts.”\nDamage To Reputations\n“The biggest threat to brands and businesses in 2023 will be reputational damage,” Ashlene Larson, the director of PR and social media for advertising agency Planit, said via email.\n“Reputational damage continues to be a threat as a result of increasing political extremism, social justice issues, environmental concerns and more. As the media landscape and social media networks become more fractured, consumers do not always know what to believe,” she noted.\n“It's not easy to undo or correct misinformation once it's out there, and brands will need to remain vigilant with monitoring for threats, being proactive with their responses and continuing to nurture direct relationships with their audiences,” Larson concluded.\nInability To Reach Target Audiences\n“It’s become increasingly difficult for brands to reach their audiences as consumers have been inundated with information overload and so many new ways to access and view content across screens,” Amy Leifer, chief advertising sales officer for DIRECTV, said via email.\n“To truly resonate with consumers in 2023, we’ll see brands continue to think outside the box to better understand and connect with their most valued customers through relevant and personalized advertising that leverages creativity and utilizes new technology,” she predicted.\nMental Health Issues In The Workplace\nRemember when this job used to be fun?\n“The biggest risks facing business in 2023 will include an ongoing epidemic of mental health issues that show up at work,” Dr. Christy Gibson, author of The Modern Trauma Toolkit and co-founder of a company that focuses on stress-related work issues, said via email.\n“Organizations are ill-prepared for this wave of psychological distress that inevitably shows up in the workplace. They don't have mandatory trauma-informed training to keep their environments safer.\n“They have no skills for psychological first aid. There aren't in-house skillsets to help people manage emotional problems. The expectations of leaders for employees to return to the status quo as if the pandemic and other collective traumas aren't happening will further contribute to the global distress,” she warned.\nSuccession planning concept. Wooden figures and arrows.\nLack Of Succession Planning\n“Boomers are the most massive American population cohort, and as boomers exit the workforce, there’s not enough succession planning or workforce replacement,” Robert Jordan, CEO and co-founder of Interim Executives, said via email.\n“Likely, we’ll see more businesses changing hands to outsiders. Successfully transitioning business ownership to either next-generation family members or external new owners will require more time and dedication to training young leaders to take on the reigns,” he predicted."

Here’s what you can expect to see in the upcoming year.\nKey Takeaways:\n\n2023 is shaping up to be a tough year for business, both big and small, according to many financial experts\nHiring available, qualified employees and keeping up with business administrative requirements were almost 50% of the total concern of small business owners\nThere some concrete things every business owner can do now to better prepare for the future\n\nYou sit back and contemplate: should you buy that property to expand? Everything seems to be opening back up. Should you spend that money on advertising to raise brand awareness for your business? And, just how are consumers faring these days, in general?\nAre they ready to buy? Tapped out?\nAs a business owner, these types of questions often run through your mind throughout your day.\nStarting a business, it should be said, is no easy feat. Keeping one going and thriving– especially now– is even tougher. While running a small or even medium sized business will always have its challenges, 2023 is already being forecast as a mountain to climb.\nLet’s take a look at concerns and issues facing small businesses in 2023 and what you can do to prepare.\nChallenges and Problems Facing Small Businesses in 2023\nContents hide\n1 Challenges and Problems Facing Small Businesses in 2023\n1.1 Small Businesses Should Prepare for Financial Challenges Like a Recession Now\n1.2 Preparing Your Small Business Marketing and Management Plan for 2023\n1.3 Win: Proactive Financial and Time Management for Small and Medium-Size Businesses\n1.4 Setting a Vision for the Future Success of your Business\n1.5 Small Business Problems: Monitoring Employee Performance and Rewarding the Right Things\n1.5.1 CEOS and Owners: Set the Bigger-Picture Process Goals by Setting the Example Early On\n1.5.2 A Culture of Follower-ism Creates a Culture of “Quiet Quitters”\n1.6 Labor Issues: Best Practices for Hiring and Retaining the Best Talent for Your Dollar\n1.7 Making Customer Service One of Your Top Business Goals\n1.8 Are you creating a trustworthy and predictable customer interface/purchase process?\n1.8.1 Lead Generation Capture\n1.8.2 Administration and Compliance: Licensing, Taxes and Changing Regulations\n1.9 Balancing Your Company’s Quality and Growth\n1.9.1 Building and Scaling Your Business at the Right Time On Your Own Terms\n1.9.2 Avoiding Founder Dependence – Creating a Business Contingency Plan\n1.9.3 Conlusion: Overcoming Problems Faced by Small Business Owners\n1.10 Frequently Asked Questions – Challenges and Problems for Small Businesses in 2023\nWhile it probably goes without saying, making money is essential to the survival of any small business. While many factors are within your control, some aren’t. Let’s start by taking a look at how the broader global economy and consumer sentiment have been shaping up of late.\nAccording to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Year-End Capital Markets Update for 2022, investors worried about the global economy’s resilience in the face of rising geopolitical risk, a sudden spike in oil prices, disruptions to supply chains, and inflationary pressures:\n\nAccording to data compiled by the National Association of Realtors, home sales dropped 35.4% between November 2021 and November 2022.\nThe Federal Reserve (the central bank) raised interest rates by a total of 425 bps in 2022. After hitting a 40-year high in June, inflation has started to moderate, but financing is becoming increasingly costly.\nThroughout the world, stocks have fallen significantly; in the United States, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P 500) entered bear market territory in the middle of the year, only to recover slightly and end with a negative YTD return of 18% in the middle of December.\nBitcoin, the world’s largest and foremost cryptocurrency, is down over 75% from its all-time highs, and the FTX crypto exchange collapse and resulting scandal has rocked the entire crypto sphere. Recent upticks have it around $23,000 per BTC.\nConcerns about slowing global economic growth and the resulting lower demand for oil and fuel have contributed to a drop in oil prices from March’s eight-year high of $123 per barrel to the current level of $73 per barrel. Affordability of gas has not spurred economic activity and retail sales, however.\nGroup life insurance actuaries are reporting record excess mortality in traditional prime working age categories in 2022.\nMost small businesses that fail did so because of lack of market demand and running out of capital investment and cash flow.\n\nRecord money printing by the Federal Reserve matched with lockdowns of sectors of the economy have caused massive disruptions in normal business activity, the results of which we may be seeing for years to come.\nSmall Businesses Should Prepare for Financial Challenges Like a Recession Now\nMany economic analysts worry that a recession has already begun or is about to begin. To put it simply, a recession is “a major fall in activity across the economy that lasts for more than a few months” (and is officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research).\nMany more people on the street get the feeling a recession is already here and we’re living in one. Almost no one can deny the real impacts of inflation that are finally starting to show up in common everyday consumer goods and commodities like fuel, rent, and food.\nVeterans who receive a monthly disability payment from the U.S. Federal Government recently saw an increase of over 14% in their monthly check. This indicates the government is anticipating more inflation in the long run, so they’re cutting the checks and paying out now to get ahead of the public relations disaster.\nBut it doesn’t fix the core problems that we’re all dealing with in our day to day lives.\nPreparing Your Small Business Marketing and Management Plan for 2023\nYou can prepare your business in the following ways:\n\nFocus on one customer. This is where the majority of your business comes from. Identify your core customer profile and focus on serving them best. That means better than you did yesterday, and better than your competition will tomorrow. Loyalty means everything, so build it now before the storm comes.\n\nWhat does your customer need and what might they benefit from, using your forward-thinking assessment of the product or service environment?\n\nDeal with the supply chain issues now. Supply issues affect the entire economy. Oftentimes it results in the ability to acquire key components among shortages and wild price swings.\n\nStock  up on discounted inventory you know you’ll need now, and always keep your customers in the know as you see trends affecting business. They’ll appreciate your transparency\n\nTurn lemons into lemonade. That supply chain issue– can it be fixed by bringing production closer to home or switching out for an alternative? Do you really want to do business with a country with serious human rights abuses? This could be the perfect opportunity to set the example for your competition, improve the customer journey and brand experience, and better your own your country.\n\nCustomers feel more loyal to businesses with a real message and mission statement. They don’t need to be bludgeoned to death with corporate -isms and empty platitudes.\n\nTrim the fat. During times aplenty, we can let things that erode our bottom line get the best of us because it might just be too complicated to get rid of something or too time-consuming when you can focus on making real money. But downtime is the perfect opportunity to consolidate processes and find ways to automate for savings.\n\nDo you really need to run your own warehouse with inventory management the traditional way? Or could you find a 3rd party shipping and storage warehouse network within the U.S. and your area of sales and automate it?\nWin: Proactive Financial and Time Management for Small and Medium-Size Businesses\nMost business owners know when they’re in the black, breaking even, or starting to pay money just to be in business, at a holistic level. For others, it’s not that easy. This is because, in the context of a small company, you are more likely to be an expert in your field than in say, accounting.\nProfit margin analysis and cash flow management are specialized talents that not everyone possesses.\nBut planning your moves on paper using figures may expose opportunities and areas for elimination and savings. That means getting and staying organized. This will remain important with consideration to scaling your business when the time comes.\nYou can consolidate and automate your finances, employee time tracking, payroll and other records, government compliance and taxes in a single suite to save time and money, and maybe even find a tax break somewhere to boot that makes you even more money.\nCheck out products like Gusto.com that help you save money and time managing your business operations and records.\nHaving an automated system in place that saves you the money and trouble of hiring an accountant or lawyer could mean massive savings in the long run, and it might take minimal research and due diligence on your own part to confirm.\nSetting a Vision for the Future Success of your Business\nIf you’re like most entrepreneurs and business owners, you only want your business to be as small as it actually needs to be. No one’s in the habit of turning down profits, and that means keeping your eye on the ball long term.\nLife is a marathon, and you’ll want to master these concepts:\n\nTime management – You only have 24 hours in a day, and you’ll need to sleep enough to stay fresh and keep going. After that, you have even less. Prioritize your must-dos, double down or leverage your winners and cut your losses as you go. Spend your time on what’s working.\nAvoid burnout and fatigue – Are you still putting in long hours into your own business? If you’re working in your business more than you are on it, you may be setting yourself up for burnout. You don’t want to get tired of the daily pace of operations where your own work-life balance and achieving your savings goals are compromised.\nUse tools, and choose the right tools – Once again, automation pays real dividends. From choosing the best workflow and project management software to keep everyone at work on the same page and eliminate miscommunications and redundancies, to getting notified when your inventory goes below a certain threshold– you’ll want to get rid of those potential failure points now.\n\nWith the abundance of software, I’d recommend only going with apps that can give you useful data related to the time it takes to complete tasks and other automated insights while keeping you compliant with all the administrative requirements of being in business and having employees.\nSmall Business Problems: Monitoring Employee Performance and Rewarding the Right Things\nWhat would a business be without its employees? Most businesses have a human element to benefit from and in reality, reliant upon. That makes it an element to manage and contend with.\nLabor concerns have consistently been top of mind for small business owners, with fewer small businesses hiring or planning to hire in the last 3 – 5 years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business in its December 2022 survey.\nCEOS and Owners: Set the Bigger-Picture Process Goals by Setting the Example Early On\nIt all starts with you: the culture, the know-how, the vision.\nCEOs and owners often hire middle managers to watch the lower-level employees so they don’t have to worry about someone stealing company time or money. However, middle managers can also create a negative feedback loop.\nMiddle managers are often content as long as everything moves at an acceptable pace, but they can also thwart new talent and voices with a fresh, creative approach to remain the perceived local expert on all things work-related.\nAn adversarial relationship between supervisor and employee is a great way to stifle innovation and growth within the ranks.\nA Culture of Follower-ism Creates a Culture of “Quiet Quitters”\nWhen people see that there are certain norms they can get away with, or unfortunately, a status quo they’re expected to support or else lose their jobs, you’re going to create quiet quitters. People will give you the bare minimum effort for a paycheck twice a month, even if it’s to enable bad management simply to survive on a personal level.\nWhen choosing supervisors in your business to manage the most important day-to-day activities, do not seek out someone that is a total follower. Better are the wounds of a friend than the kisses of an enemy.\nLabor Issues: Best Practices for Hiring and Retaining the Best Talent for Your Dollar\n\nPay them right. You should be willing to pay your employees a fair market price that truly values their future. Don’t text or email them after 7 pm. Doing so will only show that you don’t value employee space and freedom. Don’t expect free work.\n\nHold your employees more accountable with automated time tracking and payroll software, to ensure you’re only paying for billable hours as well and preventing time theft.\nThis behavior, especially by the CEO, all but guarantee eventual employee burnout and “quiet quitting,” where everyone does the bare minimum because doing otherwise would not result in any substantial benefit.\n\nTrain them right, the first time. Make sure your employees are competent and set up for success. This starts with clearly communicating expectations and making training as easy to follow as possible. This means getting rid of incompetence in the workflow, which is not a painless process.\nEliminate organizational toxicity. Keep an eye on legacy employees. They may pose a challenge to bringing on or maintaining superior talent, as legacy staff’s own values about company culture or office norms could become an obstructionary backdrop that does anything but foster the people.\n\nThe average cost of replacing an employee, even at a lower level, is over $3,000. In addition to hiring and training the right people, keeping them on board is crucial. When an employee leaves, not only do you lose their contributions to the company, but you also have to devote resources to finding and hiring a replacement.\nTo hold everyone accountable for tracking time, taking breaks, clocking in and out and making it easy for everyone to see what’s going on with their health insurance and tax forms, consider Connecteam.com. Automating certain things like clocking out can take the stress off you, the office manager, and your employees.\n\nMaking Customer Service One of Your Top Business Goals\nGetting back to the basics is important. You provide a product or service that people either want or need. All you have to do is find the best way for both of you to accomplish that exchange of value at a sum value greater than its explicit monetary value.\nThat will truly be a win-win for everyone, including your very market, at no extra cost to you. It’s also how you build a recognizable, reputable brand. Treat everyone as you’d like to be treated. But once you’ve got a basic idea of demand, it’s time to dig a little deeper, then customize your approach to each customer.\nKnowing who you’re trying to reach with your marketing and where you need to reach them is crucial. Narrowing down your target market(s) can give you a great starting point. Cross-channel marketing gives you the best chance of reaching your audience no matter where they’re spending time.\nDo you have a good, mobile-friendly website that’s easy to find and shows up for relevant keywords for your area or target customer demographic? Why not run a video ad on YouTube? There’s a good chance you’re being seen by the same person across different channels.\nThey’re all subtle reminders that you’re still there if they might happen to need you.\nAre you creating a trustworthy and predictable customer interface/purchase process?\nThe goal is to provide an element of predictability and familiarity with customers regarding how they experience your brand. People are going to see a lot of orange, yellow and red when they enter a McDonalds, but this only works in its favor.\nYou must over-deliver with a superior product and service, becoming familiar in the hearts and minds of your customers.\nLead Generation Capture\nIt sounds predatory but it’s not that bad, actually. If someone visits your website, find a way to market to them in the future, regardless of what they decide today.\nThis could be through an automatic AdWords retargeting ad on another website. It could be an email that goes out automatically upon signup from the site visitor in exchange for a benefit. It might even be an occasional text/SMS that goes out reminding people of new products and coupon codes to build loyalty.\nDon’t feel bad about trying to get their email. You’re actually making their life easier. People are busy. How many times have you pulled up something on your phone only to be distracted away from what you were doing?\nThink of it as necessary and doing them a favor, then whatever you do– don’t spam their inbox! Look at email open and conversion rates to guide you along the way.\nIf you’re B2B, make it easy for your distributors and buyers in your own network to know what’s going on and be reminded of why they do business with you.\nAdministration and Compliance: Licensing, Taxes and Changing Regulations\nThankfully, there are ways out of this predicament. Depending on your situation, outsourcing any or both tasks could be the easiest option. One choice is to hire help with administrative tasks like bookkeeping and payroll.\nUsing commonly available solutions is both faster and cheaper. Many affordable bookkeeping services exist nowadays, ready to adjust to your specific requirements. Accounting, budgeting, bank reconciliation, financial statements, and more are all services they offer.\nPayroll processing, withholding services, employee payment options (including direct deposit and check-cutting), and more are all things that many different payroll providers will offer.\nServices that manage your payroll also tend to provide all-inclusive bundles that can help you with other issues. Examples of HR-related features provided by many are time-tracking support, pre-made job descriptions, and connections to external recruitment databases.\nWhen it comes to business compliance, a payroll services provider can help with things like employee handbooks and online sexual harassment training.\nBalancing Your Company’s Quality and Growth\nKnow when to scale and when to hold off. If you’re not considering your own work/life balance, there could be consequences for everyone.\nBuilding and Scaling Your Business at the Right Time On Your Own Terms\nOnly you can eventually determine the right amount of income and tax bracket for yourself, how to file your business, and if you have the capital and a hungry market for your next move upward and outward. Just make sure to cover all your bases and plan ahead.\nIs the risk worth the reward? How much risk are you comfortable with and what would be the outcome of either doing it or not doing it?\nAvoiding Founder Dependence – Creating a Business Contingency Plan\nThe goal of every business should be to grow your business to a point that you could completely stop working, walk away and still take a salary forever, if you wanted to.\nIf you’re working in your business but not on it, then you may not be planning for the future. What would happen if you had to spend a week in the hospital? What is your continuity of operations plan? That’s where the right business insurance can help you.\nYou need to plan on scenarios where you may not be available to run your business. Or maybe you’d like to be able to give feedback and have a say at meetings, but you’re fine with letting others run it.\nThe rising cost of insurance in 2023 continues to be a challenge for businesses and regular people alike.\nConlusion: Overcoming Problems Faced by Small Business Owners\nUltimately, thinking big so you can better protect yourself and your family and have a “stop” button should you ever want to get off this ride, but be taken care of for life, is a time-proven blueprint for success. We don’t plan to fail. We fail to plan.\nAnd hopefully, it’ll result in a retirement or never-ending vacation/travel lifestyle you’ll be pleasantly surprised and excited about.\nFrequently Asked Questions – Challenges and Problems for Small Businesses in 2023\nHow can entrepeneurs overcome common challenges of small business?Maximize your marketing budget by getting, retaining, and nurturing leads. Work on your business, not in it. Don’t waste time hiring the wrong people because it costs around $3,000 – 4,000 per employee to re-hire. Automate your business licensing, compliance, employee payroll and time tracking, workflow management, and inbound marketing when possible. Don’t get burnt out.\nWhat are some recession proof products to sell?One of the top recession proof products to sell in today’s economy, replete with supply chain disruptions, is auto parts. Also, consumers will continue to spend on food and basic items, as well as tea and coffee. Marketing to a specific niche, whether it be for clothing and attire or camping equipment, may result in greater success, rather than a general store marketing approach.\nWhat are some other recession proof business ideas?With the enormous lack of homebuying power by an increasing percentage of American renters, opening a laundromat could also be a safe bet if you were able to secure financing to purchase equipment. Because people will be less likely to take out a loan to buy a new car, they might drive their old one longer and will need repairs, which is good for auto repair shops out there.  \nDigital marketing and cloud based technologies may also do well if they provide overwhelming value, savings, or additional business for their B2B clients, as many business owners will be looking for a way to overcome a recessionary atmosphere by cutting costs and refocusing their efforts and budgets.\n\nAuthor\nRecent Posts\n\n\nPatrick\nBooks available at Amazon.com\nPatrick is an entrepreneur residing in the US southeast  \n\nLatest posts by Patrick (see all)\n\nI Asked Google AI to Confirm SEO Best Practices for Single Location Business with Multiple Service Areas - June 2, 2024\nWhy Roofers Knock: A Homeowner’s Guide to Protecting Your Home from Storm Damage and Bad Business - May 14, 2024\nDitch the Expensive Daily Starbucks Coffee with Clio and Save - April 20, 2024\n\nTags:\nchallenges of small businesslabor issuesmarketing challenges for small businessproblems faced by small business ownerstime management\nLast updated on July 29, 2023\n\nPatrick\nPatrick is an entrepreneur residing in the US southeast    \nView All Posts\nPost navigation\nNext Post\nExecutive Leadership: PMO and Team Strategies That Work  \n4 Comments\n\n\nPingback: 2023 Q & A: Your Business Startup Questions Answered - Upwardpreneur\n\n\nPingback: Executive Leadership: PMO and Team Strategies That Work - Upwardpreneur\n\n\nPingback: Is Your Middle Manager Costing You? - Upwardpreneur\n\n\nPingback: How's the U.S. Consumer Holding Up These Days? - Upwardpreneur\n\n\nComments are closed\n\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCopyright 2024 — Upwardpreneur.

                "raw_content": "Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 Small Business Britain is the UK’s leading champion of small businesses, supporting all 6 million small businesses in the UK – no matter their background or circumstances, their location, their sector or their ambition. Through a series of reports, events and campaigns, Small Business Britain champions, inspires and accelerates small businesses in the UK to foster growth and increased confidence.\nAs businesses look forward to Spring however, there are signs of new hope, and at Small Business Britain it is very much our job to nurture that hope, and I do believe that by working together we can move forward in 2023 with confidence. Having narrowly avoided recession in 2023, and with signs that inflation will also come down by the end of the year, the fears of a severe economic crisis are starting to wane, and small businesses are definitely responsive to that. Talk of recession tends to do as much damage as recession itself, so talking about recovery and growth instead can have an opposite, positive impact too.\nAs the days get longer, small businesses are starting to look up, and what they are finding, with a little help, is that there are still opportunities out there. Digital engagement, skills and tools are still a huge opportunity, as is sustainability - and these two are of course linked. Businesses are becoming ever more efficient with the incredible array of digital tools now available to them, at no or low cost, and that is helping reduce waste, energy usage, travel and having a hugely positive impact on small business climate impact. What we see time and time again is that where businesses engage with one opportunity, more come along in their wake. Giving something new a go, trialling some new technology or functionality, trying a new strategy all give the small business a boost, and drive a positive upward spiral of motivation and success. The key is for businesses to always look up and out. If you hold off marketing, put the brakes on opportunity creation because you are worried about the future, then that will lead to worse outcomes. Looking forward with optimism, confidence and an openness to new things – even if you need to beg, steal or borrow that optimism from your peers and community – will lead inevitably to good things, even if the road there might be a bit bumpy at times.\nSmall Business Britain are absolutely here, with our friends at Square and Clearpay, for both those bumpy roads and the sunny uplands. I look forward to us all working together to move forward in 2023.\nMichelle Ovens CBE Small Business Britain After a bumpy Winter, small businesses are looking to the Spring for more than better weather: a return to growth, a return to footfall, and a boost to optimism that is sorely needed. At Small Business Britain, we have worked with small businesses throughout the Winter and what is clear from our research with Square and Clearpay is that there are significant challenges still on the horizon. There is also significant opportunity remaining, and with a bit of small business savvy and support, there are good times ahead.\nSmall businesses, entrepreneurs, are always naturally buoyant, always looking for opportunities and endlessly optimistic. But even this has been tested as we have gone from one crisis to another. Whether it be Brexit, Covid, cost of living crisis, war in Ukraine, climate crisis, there seems no end to what small businesses have been dealing with and many are feeling the strain, and no small amount of exhaustion.\nForeword Michelle Ovens CBE Small Business Britain Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Foreword | 5 Small businesses are the backbone of the UK economy. Accounting for 99.9% of the business population, they provide growth and employment opportunities in communities up and down the country. The past few years have been particularly challenging for these businesses having to deal with the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and broader economic uncertainty.\nAt Square and Clearpay, meeting the needs of small businesses and helping them grow are at the heart of everything we do. Square and Clearpay are both part of Block, Inc, a global technology company with a purpose to build technology that gives everyone equal opportunity and access to the economy. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools and resources they need to succeed, regardless of their size or industry.\nThat’s why we’re proud to support small businesses through our ongoing partnership with Small Business Britain, to provide businesses with the guidance they need to thrive in today’s rapidly changing business landscape.\nBased on our research with more than 1,000 UK small businesses, we’ve gained valuable insights into the challenges businesses are facing and how they’re adapting to changing circumstances. We’ve heard from them about the difficulties they experienced during Christmas trading last year with consumer spending down, and how they’re looking to build confidence, utilise digital skills, become more sustainable, and increase their resilience.\nOne of the key lessons we learned from the pandemic, and which has been further highlighted in this research, is the importance of digital skills and tools. As businesses were forced to adapt to remote work and online sales, those that had already invested in digital infrastructure were better positioned to weather the storm.\nThe adoption of digital payments and omnichannel selling has accelerated as businesses had to make dramatic changes to their operations and these trends are here to stay. We’ve seen a significant increase in businesses that typically only accepted payments in-store and were cash-only, now adopting online payments, QR code ordering, and other payment innovations to survive.\nAs business and health regulations continue to change, it’s more important than ever for businesses to have access to integrated tools that allow them to pivot and adapt so they can sell online or in-store. Looking ahead, businesses must remain agile and open to these new technologies to thrive and compete in today’s rapidly changing business landscape.\nIn this report we highlight the benefits that these new technologies can bring to small businesses. We understand that every business is different, whether you’re a cashless store already selling on Instagram or a cash-only shop with no online presence. This report aims to meet you where you are and equip you with the necessary knowledge to maximise the benefits of technology in your business, so you can stay ahead of the game. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to succeed, and we’re proud to work with Small Business Britain to support the UK’s small business community. We hope this research report will be a valuable resource for small businesses as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of 2023 and beyond.\nSamina Hussain-Letch Head of Payment Partnerships and Operations UK at Square Foreword Samina Hussain-Letch Head of Payment Partnerships and Operations UK at Square Rich Bayer Clearpay UK and EU Country Manager How do small businesses move forward after the major challenges that we have seen over the past few years? Together with Square and Clearpay, Small Business Britain has examined this question in depth.\nAs we find ourselves well into 2023, small businesses are at a key inflection point. Coming out of a difficult winter, when seasonal lights twinkled a little less brightly than hoped. And heading into a spring that on one-hand offers hope and optimism, but also has many challenges on the horizon. As fears of a UK recession calm, and with hopeful signs that inflation will come down by the end of the year, the economic outlook is more positive. Small businesses are heartened by this, but they are also bruised and battle-weary, and in major need of help to navigate and boost them on the route ahead. In this report, we focus on identifying the most effective ways to support and empower small businesses in the UK to move forward into a period of growth and success in 2023.\nThe top-line of our research shows businesses have reported considerable challenges over the signs that many are pressing on regardless, in the hope that better things are coming. Our data shows a mixed picture over Christmas, but one that was lack-lustre for many small businesses. Escalating inflation, gloomy headlines about recession and strike disruption meant a lot of businesses saw consumer demand decline precisely when their outgoings were surging, whether that be from crippling energy costs, supply chain costs or finance costs.\nThe good news is that 41% of businesses reported having a ‘good’ or ‘great’ festive trading season. But alongside this is a larger proportion of business owners who found their first Christmas period without lockdown restrictions disappointing. Over a third (36%) said the season was not as good as usual, but they got by. And even more worryingly, 10% of businesses reported a poor festive season which left them worried about the future, while 7% found Christmas trading to be a major issue.\nExecutive Summary Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Executive Summary | 9 Confidence Game Why does this matter for future growth? Seasonal trade is vital to small businesses, and the absence of a winter boost means many small businesses lack important reserves for the year ahead and are also starting from a lower base of confidence. Perhaps unsurprisingly 87% of small businesses are worried about recession. This nervousness translates into caution. Nearly 40% of businesses think they will either not grow, or even decline, in 2023. However, more positively 61% of entrepreneurs believe they will experience growth in the next 12 months. But this is set against signs that small businesses are delaying growth plans for their business, to manage short term cash challenges. Almost one fifth (17%) of businesses have delayed expansion and 13% of businesses have delayed hiring. Many small firms tell us that hiring people with the right skills remains a major headache, even if they are in the position to take staff on.\nNot only do we need to see more small businesses achieving this growth, but also more believing that they can. As our report illustrates, with a brightening economic picture, there is huge scope for turning the story around for small businesses. But in a world of perpetual uncertainty the conversation for small businesses must also change.\nBy nature entrepreneurs tend to be a uniquely positive group, and the UK’s small businesses have shown incredibly inspiring courage and tenacity to succeed over the past few years. But we need to hear more talk of growth, hope, and opportunity. This is what will inspire more opportunities and fire up the nation’s 5.5 million small businesses to be the engine of growth, jobs, and innovation that the UK so badly needs. This effort must be driven by leaders across the economy; from government, from big business, from supply chains and customers too. This new narrative must certainly embrace the ongoing conversation around resilience that has developed over COVID, Brexit, cost of living crisis and more. Lessons learnt in these periods have been hard on businesses, so making the most of those learnings will help businesses get to where they need to be. With rocky roads likely to happen at some point again, businesses need to create a resiliency with back up plans and diverse routes to market.\nDigital Dividends Digital plays a critical role at the heart of growth and resilience, and businesses need to be open to new things; new technology, innovation (even small things) in digital and also in finance. The hunkering down mentality seen over the winter needs to be converted into a greater openness to trying new things. The law of probability indicates that at least one of these things could be the key to a bright new future. Indeed, one key area of potential is sustainability, which remains a growing hot topic across society. We are likely to see new opportunities emerge now, and in the future, as new developments open up for small businesses to reduce their costs and engage powerfully with a growing customer base that is keen to focus on sustainability.\nWhile we have generally seen a broader, positive trend for businesses to embrace digital throughout the pandemic and since, there are concerning signs that investment in this, and other vital areas for business growth, are stalling, or even falling. Our data shows that 54% of small businesses have not invested in their, or their staff’s, digital skills, or added new technology in the last year. Short-term savings, long term risk And this is not the only concerning trend to be identified in this research. Many small businesses have responded to the current challenging market conditions by managing spend – specifically in the critical area of marketing. Almost one third (31%) of businesses have delayed marketing spend, whilst 27% have cut it. While the need to reduce costs is understandable, cutting marketing activity is counter-productive, as it also jeopardises an important sales and revenue driver, both now and in the future. Instead, as this report sets out, there needs to be more support and encouragement for firms to use innovative approaches to marketing at lower or no cost. And more help and advice to help businesses find better ways to manage costs, whether that be sustainability savings, or evaluating and negotiating supply chains. For example, only 19% of businesses have sourced lower cost raw materials to create their products or services. After a turbulent period with more than its fair share of challenges, it is time for small businesses to move on and put their best foot forward. Undoubtedly there will continue to be bumps along the road, but with sustainability, innovation and optimism underpinning a resilient growth agenda for small businesses, there is every reason to be hopeful for a better 2023.\nSmall Business Britain, Square and Clearpay are committed to supporting businesses through this by sharing practical, relevant tools, advice and opportunities as the year progresses.\n87% Number of small businesses owners worried about recession Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Executive Summary | 11 Responding to a Winter Storm Christmas 2022 was lack lustre at best, and whilst the UK narrowly avoided recession, it had a significant impact on small businesses, creating worries about the future and having some concerning impacts on decision making. Whilst not returning to COVID downturns, the winter season did not bring the boost businesses need, and many still face crippling energy, supply chain and finance costs. Whilst the prevailing need to push on through to Spring is encouraging, businesses need to keep an eye on their customers and marketing in order to prevent facilitating their own demise. “Parents being able to work from home has taken a lot of our work away, also the strikes have had a big impact. The last 2 years have been quite devastating - since the pandemic the needs have greatly reduced. Parents were working from home so we weren’t needed. We’re at about 25% occupancy compared to 2019. People have less to spend so they are looking at different and cheaper ways - neighbours, sharing the childcare. The people that do this are great but it’s not the same as using a registered childcare provider.” Fiona Campbell Managing Director, Crazy Capers Ltd While many businesses were optimistic about the first Christmas period without lockdown restrictions, they faced an additional challenge with disruptions to transport services negatively impacting on footfall. Despite these difficulties, it was encouraging to see that 41% of businesses reported having a good or great festive trading season. This is a testament to the resilience and determination of small businesses to succeed. Another 36% found the season was not as good as usual, but they got by. This is a big group of small businesses, and a concerning statistic. With 10% of businesses having a poor festive season and worried about the future, as well as 7% finding Christmas trading to be a major issue, it becomes apparent that the Christmas period was not the lifeline many businesses were hoping for after such a challenging year.\n87% of businesses came into the new year worried about the recession, yet still 61% of respondents believe they will experience growth in the next 12 months. That is very encouraging indeed! This ability to continue to be optimistic in difficult times is a defining characteristic of entrepreneurs which we have seen demonstrated time and time again. It takes optimism to start your own business: the belief that you can make something happen out of nothing is inherently optimistic. This is good news. The response to difficult trading conditions over the festive season is interesting and potentially suggests opportunities for a change in direction in 2023. Businesses that have pressed on or are facing serious challenges are looking for the best route forward in 2023, and some concerning trends are emerging – or perhaps some opportunities to do things a bit differently. £ £ Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Responding to a Winter Storm | 13 Marketing Has To Stay Small businesses have responded to challenging market conditions over the past 6 months by managing spend – specifically, and concerningly, in marketing. 31% of businesses have delayed marketing spend whilst 27% have cut it. Marketing drives sales, supports future sales and engages customers to continue to bring cash in the door over coming months.\nWhen businesses are concerned about income, it is natural to look for areas to cut. However, marketing should not be at the top of that list. It is a short-term saving and a long-term challenge: when the pipeline dries up it is much harder to get a marketing and sales operation back up and running, and there will always be a lead time to translating it into sales. If businesses are feeling the pinch, there are other ways they can manage costs that will have less of an impact on on-going sales. There are also many ways to engage in marketing that are low or no cost. Businesses should investigate new and innovative approaches to marketing to ensure that they don’t put their future sales pipeline at risk. 1. Use free social media platforms Focus on platforms such as Instagram with 2 billion monthly active users and TikTok with over 1 billion, and focus on regular posting and video. Instagram has great, free in-platform analytics that can tell you how your posts are doing – so keep an eye and when a post does well, learn and repeat! 2. Start and grow a mailing list Social media is great, but you don’t ‘own’ it. If you have a mailing list, the power is in your hands. Many providers allow people to start growing their lists for free, and this means you can contact your customers whenever you like, whether this is to tell them about a product launch, a sale, or maybe the opportunity to grow a focus group. You can even automate this to save time and make sure you are communicating regularly.\n3. Up-skill yourself Professional images and videos are great, but if you are on a budget, you don’t need to spend this money. Your phone is all you need to create great videos and quality images for social media and beyond if you learn how to use it well. Head on over to YouTube and start learning for free. Even when you have the budget to hire in the pros, being able to take good videos and images when they’re not there will be hugely useful.\n4. Nurture the press There are so many free opportunities just waiting to be taken if you put yourself in the right place and offer value. Research (by which we mean have a Google around...) the relevant magazines and websites in addition to bloggers and influencers and start to see what kind of content they produce. Do they like news stories? Tips? Do they create buyer guides? Do they run competitions? Then find the right contact (which can often be done through the website or by calling the office) and start sending them relevant information! And do not think they won’t be interested in you- if you provide relevant content in a timely manner, why wouldn’t they be?\n5. Collaborate This is such an easy one and one that so many people miss. Working with brands that align but don’t conflict or compete with yours is a great way to not only extend your network and find more potential customers, but also to help the other brand too. Whether you run a competition together, share guest blogs, or maybe even do lives on social media that appeal to everyone, you’re getting yourself out in front of more relevant people, which is what it’s all about!\n6. Use online directories Buy now pay later platforms, web service platforms, and more provide customers with shop directories. This is a great way to reach a new audience without spending extra on marketing.\nRhea Freeman Rhea Freeman PR Top Tips For Marketing On A Budget 31% 27% of small businesses have delayed marketing spend of small businesses have cut marketing spend Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Responding to a Winter Storm | 15 “I sell British made gifts, art and homeware. I started in 2012 with an online shop. I then had a high street shop in 2016 in Ashford, part of the Mary Portas regeneration scheme, then moved the shop to Cranbrook where I stayed for six years. My shop is now in Canterbury as I moved there in October last year.\nGenerally, things are feeling kind of medium – it is quiet. I am still finding my feet now in a city rather than in a town. People are being cautious and are enjoying a bargain. I do not think that I have made cutbacks to spending as such, but I have not maybe grown as quickly as I would have hoped. I can’t think of any costs I have cut - I think that I will just be gently trying to grow. Selling overseas is something that I would really like to do.\nIf it wasn’t for digital technology then my business would have collapsed in 2020. People were so obedient and I would send out a newsletter saying ‘please buy this’ and they would! Developing online and installing a POS system has made everything much more seamless - it feels so much more simple and grown up. I want to increase my website sales going forward. Currently online sales make up about 10% of my income, but would like it to be about 45%. I want the website to be a true reflection of what is in the shop. I don’t have the ambition of having a chain or having someone else run the business for me. I want to do what I do well and make some money from it.\nI would say I am quietly optimistic. I do not think that change is going to happen very quickly but by the end of this year I think things will have settled a little. My one piece of advice to other small businesses is take every opportunity to learn things. I started when I was 17 in retail and I’m now 44 and still don’t know everything.” Small Business Britain spoke to Kate Tompsett, Founder of Happy and Glorious, about her experience this winter and how she is remaining optimistic, despite the challenging environment: quietly optimistic When it comes to keeping your costs in check, taking a closer look at your supply chain is a great place to start. It is all about getting a handle on the prices you’re paying for the products or services you’re getting from your suppliers. But it is not just about the cost, it is also important to consider things like delivery times, payment terms and how dependable your suppliers are. From our survey we found that only 19% of businesses have sourced lower cost raw materials to create their products or services. Re-examining the supply chain can bring great opportunities for margin management. Many small businesses report that they rarely renegotiate, and often have agreements in place that are years old or commit them to long term contracts – including payment terms that have never been reviewed. Taking some time to review and renegotiate these may open up more breathing room in margins for small businesses and could mean that marketing activities can stay. In the meantime, focusing on marketing that does not have to cost the earth will keep businesses moving forward when costs are tight.\n“We did really well over Christmas, but not as good as last year. Not just because people are spending less but the postage strikes meant that I had to cut off ordering earlier than usual. Some stock went off because of the delays. I’ve approached some local shops to see if they want to sell my items and want to look into the possibility of me doing some kind of subscription - they would pay a small amount each month so that they can then spend that credit when they want to.” Celia McDonald Owner, For Dogs Sake Treats Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Responding to a Winter Storm | 17 Spring Forward With Confidence As we move into Spring, small businesses are looking for a boost to their confidence to lift them up from a difficult winter. Talk about recession and no end to inflationary pressures had a downward impact on business confidence, and businesses looked to leadership in media, government and across society to find reasons to be optimistic. “Christmas was amazing although it was quite nerve wracking - there has been a lot of bad press in the media about the cost of living crisis which has whipped up some frenzy. There is uncertainty and that is affecting customer confidence. We were worried about what stock to buy and how much but we did really well. People are still being invited to birthday parties, average basket size is down and spending is a little bit lower than it would have been but we’ve ticked on and have bought in more lines for under a tenner.” Amanda Alexander Founder, Giddy Goat Toys Our research found that nearly 40% of businesses think they will either not grow or actually decline in 2023. This is absolutely not the direction of travel the economy needs to recover from teetering on the edge of recession, or the message businesses need to hear from Government in particular.\nThere are concerning signs that small businesses are delaying growth plans for their business. 17% of businesses have delayed expansion and 13% of businesses have delayed hiring. Delaying key growth activities may feel necessary to manage short term cash challenges, but it will lead to medium term slowdown in growth and recovery overall. Small businesses continue to face significant financial challenges in the business. Energy remains high on business’s minds and there remains concern about the impact of Government support for energy bills, particularly with the changes to the support package that came in at the start of April. Even with these financial hurdles, small businesses are still not looking externally for finance to support the business. There is a nervousness about taking risk, and a worry about interest rates. If businesses continue to be nervous and avoid risk, there will inevitably be an impact on business growth and success: a concerning trend for 2023. Businesses that can overcome the weight of the challenges in their business and the wider economy to face the future with a positive plan for growth are however reporting an increased optimism across the board, which in turn leads to better planning and decision making. Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Spring Forward With Confidence | 19 It is not clear that small businesses see Government as having a key role to play in picking them up from the current challenges. Only 7% of businesses in our research had received support from Government in the last year, a sharp contrast to during the pandemic when huge programmes such as Furlough, Bounce Back Loans, SEISS, local council grants and more meant that many turned for the first time to government support, either locally or at a national level.\nAlthough the pandemic may have turned a corner, economic challenges remain and both Government and the private sector can play a role in picking businesses back up again. It does not have to involve financial intervention as it did during the Pandemic, but there are things we can all do to bring a spring back to small businesses. Jasmin Barlow-Wilkinson, founder of Homemade Café, told us; “The media are a large part of the problem and it is amazing how quickly people can be swayed into a different mindset just by what is reported. The hospitality industry relies on people going out and feeling good. I feel like we have done ok through the pandemic and cost of living crisis, we have been luckier than a lot of other places. I did have to work my socks off though. I had the focused mindset - I was determined to not let my years of hard work be wasted.\nWe did use Square in the kiosk and bakery, and also for the pop ups. I changed the till to Square over lockdown for the cafe so people have the option to order from the tables and that has been a game changer. Square made things a lot easier and it is so useful for me to see what has happened each day - I’m more in control of seeing what has gone on. My advice to small businesses is to prepare yourself for the rollercoaster. You have to be adaptable and be able to think on your feet all the time.” Confidence With the focus earlier this year on a potential recession, the message small businesses (and their customers) were receiving was that things are bad and times are tough. Businesses find this unhelpful and are looking to government, media and influential voices and their supply chain for a more positive story. Post budget, with the chance of recession this year receding, there is a great opportunity to tell a more positive story to businesses.\nEven in a flat economy, there are always areas of opportunity. Many businesses continue to do well, new businesses are starting and there are positive signs that inflation is starting to come down. Businesses need to hear about areas of opportunity, not just of challenge, in order to create plans for growth and create the jobs and contribution to GDP that small businesses have historically played such a big role in.\nDigital Skills and Technology The announcement of a new government department, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, suggests a renewed focus on technology and innovation, as does the Chancellor’s goal of creating a Silicon Valley in the UK. There is an opportunity in 2023 to bring small business, key innovation drivers, into this conversation. Small businesses, like Jasmin, have found digital skills and technology to be transformational to their business, but we know from our research that 54% of small businesses have not invested in their or their staff’s digital skills or added new technology in the last year. There is a big gap here and an opportunity with a new departmental focus to fill it.\n“It has been very tough - the hardest time that my business has ever had in the 11 years I have been operating. I don’t think I realised how well it was going pre-COVID! When everyone started to go online, I did really well but of course it dropped off when the Summer hit and the weather improved - and footfall in some groups has carried on slowing down. I think that the cost-of-living crisis is just a bridge too far for people and I’ve noticed a massive drop in some of my offerings, thank goodness not all of them. The positive way to look at it all is it’s put another rocket up my arse! Being a small business owner, and always having to be resilient and flexible, I’m really pushing and trying to grow my YouTube channel; I am creating another Festival Tour over the Summer and I am really excited about a new subscription service I am developing so I can continue with my mantra of ‘music and singing for everyone’, not only in this country but globally.” Catriona Bateman Owner, Little Folk Nursery Rhymes Ltd Jasmin Barlow-Wilkinson Founder, Homemade Café Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Spring Forward With Confidence | 21 1. Stretch yourself Trust yourself and take the opportunities you see or are offered along the way – stepping into the stretch zone and increasing the size of your comfort zone is essential when growing your confidence – suddenly things that once felt daunting can become part of your norm. When we actively push ourselves and take risks we can increase our confidence, begin to understand and trust our capabilities with an added bonus of learning constantly, even if things don’t entirely work out as planned. 2. Manage your boundaries Saying yes and figuring out how you are going to deliver later is often a wonderful trait of many business owners, and this helps grow you and your business. However, it is important to consider your boundaries: how do you feel about saying no? And if you are saying ‘yes’ to something, what are you potentially saying ‘no’ to? How can you manage your boundaries effectively, so you are valuing you, your time, energy and focus. 3. Find your tribe Identify your people, people who will help encourage you when your confidence is low, or when you are doubting yourself. It is essential to have mentors, friends and family members who will remind you how amazing you are in times of need!\n4. Duty of self-care Look after yourself and make ‘you’ your priority as this can only positively impact on your capacity and confidence. You can’t keep your focus and drive if you are tired and running on empty. Model how you would like the wellbeing culture of your business to be now, and as it grows in the future. Managing your rest and recovery is crucial to feeling good and confident in your own ability – it also helps with creativity. 5. Success setting – plan backwards!\nConsider what success means to you – not just in your business but in all of life, relationships, finances and in what brings you joy. Acknowledge how you will know you are feeling successful and scale where you are against your criteria right now. You might be closer than you think. Work on enjoying the process – the process is as important as reaching your feelings of success. 5 Top Tips for Growing your Confidence Between taking control in the business, external support and leadership from across society, we can get a Spring back in our small business steps and set on a better, more positive course for the rest of 2023. Training and Staff Staffing remains a key issue for businesses with well reported talent shortages and small businesses in particular sharing challenges in growing staff skills or recruiting staff ready for the business. Small businesses need support in finding skilled staff, training staff and also in knowing what to focus on and when: in short, there is a strong need for mentoring for small businesses in this area. Often businesses find that they have a need but are not clear on how to address it. Intervention with mentoring specifically in this area can help unlock potential. This is not just about Government intervention and the private sector can and does play a big role here. Access to mentoring, skills and digital technology as well as a renewed optimism can also come from the private sector too. Small businesses can also take control of their confidence and we asked Alexis Powell-Howard MA BACP (ACCRED), founder of Fortis Therapies, to share her tips on how to get back on top.\nRunning your own business or side hustle is an amazing challenge and just like every other human on the planet, there are times when owners have more confidence, more capacity and more energy….and times when we do not!\nIf you are feeling confident, you will be more effective in many ways – in being consistent, being clear in your communication, being able to lead the way, and in being proactive. Here are some top tips to help. mentoring and intervention Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Spring Forward With Confidence | 23 A Sustainable Year Sustainability has been a standout area for growth over the past year, even despite the economic downturn and the ongoing uncertainty of the UK business environment. With the climate crisis becoming ever more acute, it is a topic that is likely to make its way to the forefront over the next year, and years to come, and is already an area in which small businesses can find real opportunities for growth. Small businesses will increasingly need to be ready to implement green practises, adapt to new ways of thinking and consider the environmental impact of their business operations – luckily adaptability, flexibility and innovation are things they are inherently good at. We know that small businesses have a clear drive to increase their sustainability activity; Research done by Small Business Britain and Oxford Brookes Business School last year encouragingly showed that 71% of small firms in the UK said they were likely to take action to reduce their carbon emissions over the next two years. Small Business Britain has already seen this desire to take action play out in real terms thanks to their Sustainability Basics and Business for Good Programmes, which have seen over 1500 businesses also commit to furthering their green skills. “Sustainability has always been at the heart of my little jewellery business. Even so, I’m constantly learning and pushing myself to improve where I can. In line with my pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2026, this year I’m baselining my workshop emissions using smart plugs, so I can understand where I can reduce my energy use and where I need to offset” Leila Arakji Founder, Ethical jewellery company Lilac Tree Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | A Sustainable Year | 25 “Our research reveals that Gen Z consumers care deeply about sustainability, with nearly 3/4 buying sustainable products when possible. Brands with poor reputations on sustainability and ethics are seeing abandonment by Gen Z. However, not all is lost as they are willing to forgive and forget when brands change their approach and buy into sustainable and ethical practices. To attract Gen Z spend, businesses need to get on board with sustainability in an authentic manner that is true to their business identity.” Rich Bayer Clearpay UK and EU Country Manager Whilst the positive environmental and social impacts of committing to sustainability are evident, consumer research completed in January 2023 by Small Business Britain and Oxford Brookes Business School also underlined the real commercial advantage of doing so. The research found that 61% of consumers feel the sustainability of a business is important when they consider where to spend their money.\nAdditionally, Clearpay research with over 1,000 Gen Z UK consumers in 2022 found that one in three customers aged 11-26 have gone as far as abandoning a brand in the last 12 months based on that brand’s reputation for sustainability and ethics. A clear trend is emerging that customers are choosing businesses who share their values and favouring those that are committing to a greener future. Our research with businesses over the Winter has understandably shown that they are concerned about rising costs across the board, meaning many have resisted investment and cut back on operational costs. The perceived financial burden of implementing sustainability in their business can prove to be a barrier. However, when considering sustainability, the first step need not be to invest in new strategies or the latest technologies but should be to consider areas to cut back on. Reduction across the board is one the most effective ways to help the environment. By minimising travel, energy usage and packaging, not only can a business help the planet, but it has the welcomed knock-on effect of reducing costs too. 5 Top Tips for being more sustainable Write your policy Consider what you sell Reduce packaging, not just plastic free Reduce electricity usage Electric vehicles: Focus on the journey It is the case though that many businesses do not know where to start. Expert and founder of Small99, which is focused on leading 1 million businesses to net zero, Adam Bastock, shares his top tips for small businesses to get going with a plan for sustainability, and explains how it does not have to be complicated and the most important thing is progress.\nSmall Business: Moving Forward 2023 | A Sustainable Year | 27 1. Reduce Electricity Usage a. If you’re unable to do the big things like installing solar, then start small with Smart Plugs. At ~£10 per plug, they’re a great way to schedule devices to turn off out of hours. b. Do a walk around your building too, and check you have LEDs in every fitting. They cut usage by 80%+, and pay themselves back in less than a year.\n2. Electric Vehicles: Focus on the Journey a. When you’re considering a change to your vehicle, sketch out what your week looks like in terms of distance, locations and journey times. b. Only once you have an accurate idea of your needs start to look at alternatives. c. It may be that new cycle lanes locally mean that an electric cargo bike can replace a van, or a second hand EV has enough range to cover your actual weekly mileage.\n3. Reduce Packaging, not just plastic free a. Packaging is one of the first places you’ll have already made progress if you’ve gone plastic-free. However even plastic-free packaging has an impact! b. No-one likes opening an oversized box that’s stuffed full of unnecessary paper. Instead, reduce the amount of packaging you use and find boxes that are appropriately sized for your items. Where possible, use cardboard as it’s more easily recycled by your customers than biodegradable plastics. 4. Consider what you sell a. The biggest part of your environmental impact is your supply chain. Think of every purchase decision you make, and what environmental impact that business has. b. While you may already have swapped packaging, the products you put in those boxes may still be “plastic-full”. c. Where do your products come from, and how does your customer dispose of it? d. Look into alternatives such as upcycling, refurbishing or repairing items for resale. This “circular economy” approach is an opportunity to reduce costs, improve profits and reduce your impact.\n5. Write your Policy a. You may well have already taken some of the above actions. But have you told others about it? b. One of the biggest issues small businesses face is “green hushing” where your action on sustainability isn’t discussed, which in turn makes others less likely to take action. c. Grab a piece of paper, write a list of bullet points of all the things you have done, are working on, or are planning to do in the future. Use this as a basis to build your sustainability policy and be proud and shout about it! Small changes such as favouring digital communication tools such as video conferencing over in-person meetings can have advantageous effects in many areas of business. It can help firms cut back on travel which not only reduces overall carbon emissions but also improves overall operational sustainability and efficiency. Once businesses tap into the opportunities that sustainability can bring a new world of possibilities - and potential income streams – open up. With the British Business Bank estimating that small businesses are responsible for around 50% of all UK business carbon emissions, making strides with sustainability is becoming ever more vital. Businesses need not fear the adoption of green practises but should welcome the exciting benefits that come with it. Progressing in this area is a chance to create real impact whilst attracting new customers and maintaining a good reputation with current ones.\nEmbracing sustainability is a win for the business and a win for the planet. And that can only be good news for 2023. “In 2023 and beyond, we will continue to prioritise our tree-planting initiative, expand our support to more charities, maintain our single-use plastic-free policy, and work closely with SEDEX-registered suppliers to improve our sustainability practices. We have also pledged to become NetZero by 2030” Marc Bucci Founder, Social Socks 5 Top Tips for Being More Sustainable Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | A Sustainable Year | 29 Over the past few years, small businesses have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of major challenges. Despite significant headwinds, businesses have become more digitally engaged, increased their productivity, reduced waste and are more open to change. This resiliency has been forged in difficult times, but will set businesses up well for the future. With continued economic and political uncertainty and with the impact of climate change at the top of everyone’s mind, businesses need to focus on their resiliency like never before. There can no longer be a resiliency plan during a crisis and a return to business as usual: businesses need to focus on this as part of general business planning so that they can face the future with confidence and reassurance. We can see from our research that many businesses - 42% - continue to invest in their or their staff’s digital skills and technology throughout the year. This is creating opportunities, increasing productivity and providing new routes to market. However, the fact that 54% of businesses are not investing in these areas presents an opportunity for growth. 59% of businesses are certain that investing in skills and technology will positively impact their business, a strong vote of confidence indeed. “As an artist and practitioner, I have had to cut back in terms of materials and many other costs. I have been more resourceful as things are so expensive. As a result, I now pay for the best Zoom package out there so that I can do diverse things. The option of being able to transition my workshops to a virtual platform has been such a marvellous and eco-friendly idea.’” Victoria Ajoku Founder and Artist, Fan The Glory With Tori Lessons learnt during COVID need to be remembered as they apply just as much during other crises: flooding, snow storms, even unpredictable challenges such as social media platforms going down for 24 hours. It is clear that businesses need back up plans, and flexible business plans that can adapt to uncertainty and allow the business to continue and even thrive when things go wrong. “We feel pretty optimistic, the economy will recover and there are some people who aren’t affected, not everyone reacts to this kind of thing in the same way. Think outside the box, you need to be reactive, try and find a solution.” Vanessa Barzasi Co Founder and CEO, BioBright A Resilient Future Have you increased your / your staff’s digital skills or added new technology to your business in the last year?\nYes 46% No 54% Not sure 4% Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | A Resilient Future | 31 Businesses need to develop back up plans, diversified strategies, and always think about alternatives should the primary route to market fail for some reason. This could include leveraging digital channels for marketing, exploring alternative payment methods, tapping into different marketing channels and more. Whilst avoiding spreading themselves too thin, small businesses can really maximise the opportunities of digital channels to give themselves back up plans. It may be a website in addition to a store; it may be Instagram shopping as well as a website; it may be a big platform as well as social media selling. Whatever the back up plan, and the back up on a back up, using technology and data, and upskilling staff accordingly, will give businesses confidence and resilience for the future. A bit of planning, flexibility, and a keen eye on the data of the business can give you the confidence to both continue and try new things. Regularly checking in on these areas rather than waiting for a crisis to bring the problems to the fore is critical to the resilience of small businesses in 2023 and beyond.\nWhat is clear from our conversations with small businesses is that there is scope for flexibility and bouncing back from challenges. Businesses are becoming more resilient, more optimistic and more confident.\nAs Spring turns to Summer, we can look forward to a brighter future for small businesses. As energy prices and inflation begin to decrease and customers begin to regain their confidence, small businesses can leverage these positive trends and position themselves for long-term success.\n1. Building a resilient business starts with having a business plan.\nYou should have a clear view of your goals, financial targets, cashflow, marketing and the products or services you provide. This does not need to be huge – even a page or two detailing the basics means you have a solid plan to refer to. This should give you comfort in knowing you have the basics nailed so when looking at growing or cutting costs, you know where and how to do it.\n2. Niche or diversify? There is no straight answer as only you know your customers and market best. Sitting down to plan out the options, you should come up with a good answer – but do look at the data. Gut feel is great too, but having solid sales figures and information will support your decision. Being niche can differentiate you, which is great, and you could charge more. However, if you are reliant on one service, product or client you may want to diversify for more financial resilience.\n3. Track your business data. This does not need to be complicated – it could be as simple as tracking your sales, profit, margin, overheads, marketing spend, social media and web analytics or customer footfall. If something changes, you should see the impact quickly and be able to deal with it. It is not all negative – if you advertise and get inundated with sales, or you win a new contract, ensure you have planned for this uptick and have the resources ready.\n4. Do you have a team or are you your business? Having a clear guide, or a simple handbook, for running your business means someone can take over if needed. If you work alone, what is your back up plan if you are away? Plan ahead for scheduled breaks so you can take time out. Equally if you are taken ill, can someone in a similar business cover for you? You could reciprocate so you both have a back-up.\n5. Remember, in a small business YOU are a massive part of it. Make sure you focus on your own health, wellbeing and balance. A great business plan can only be used if there is a well-supported business owner to lead it. Keep an eye on your boundaries and if you think they are getting blurred, then you may need to readjust.\nWe asked small business resilience expert Emma Mills-Sheffield, founder of Mindsetup, for her top tips on building resilience into your small business: 5 Top Tips for Building Resilience “It’s been good, fairly flat year on year revenue wise but profit is up 10%. I cut back on things that I could and I’m looking to expand into new platforms this year. I find it tough being a sole trader and not having any staff is the hardest thing for me. I don’t have enough money to outsource any of the admin duties and so on.” Rachel Warner Owner, RS Footwear Emma Mills-Sheffield Founder, Mindsetup Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | A Resilient Future | 33 Driving Growth Even with a broadly flat economy, there is absolutely opportunity for small businesses to grow. Despite the major challenges of the last few years, there have still been small “winners”. This offers inspiration for the sector and lessons learnt can help small businesses succeed. 60% of businesses expect their business to grow to some degree in 2023, with over 16% expecting growth over 50%. There are strong signs that small businesses have not given up on a growth agenda.\n“We have been getting some very good feedback from clients about what we do - that’s been so nice. They think that we are amazing and have asked if we can be referred to others - the referrals are going well. It means that the teams are working well and that makes me super proud. We’ve been trying to come up with new offerings - coming into 2023 we’ve been looking at ways we can diversify and de risk the business. Re-positioning some of our offers and that’s had some great responses. Business coaches often advise ‘to find your niche’ but we have looked at what else we could be offering and have actually pitched to a lot of existing clients.” Stacey Kehoe Founder, Brandlective Communications ltd.\n“Over the last year we’ve really grown, starting off at home and now I’m in a 1500 sq.ft warehouse. There’s always opportunity in a recession, people want things cheaper and people need to get rid of stock. I’d like to grow the business more in America. I did about 5-7% of sales there last year and I’d like to make the most of the currency rates, I just use general ads at the moment so I might look at how I can tailor things to that market.” Rob Oakley Owner, Oakley Home and Gifts 60% of businesses expect to grow in 2023 Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Driving Growth | 35 Small businesses have the agility to respond to market conditions and are often the source of innovation in creating new ideas, solutions, products and services. Harnessing this agility and creativity will be critical to driving growth. New businesses will start up, growth will drive job creation and spend up the supply chain, and will support the stability and vibrancy of local communities, the heart of small businesses.\nSmall businesses report digital technology as a key factor in driving growth. 59% of businesses believe that new digital skills and technology will positively enhance their business (none think it will damage their business, which is reassuring too). Even with this knowledge of the upside, still 54% of businesses did not increase digital skills or technology in their business in the last year, leaving huge scope for improvement, and growth, in 2023. There is also marked increase in optimism and growth expectations amongst ethnic minority led businesses, which we have seen come out of the research. 28% expect to grow more than 50% this year, significantly higher than the 16% for the total population. There is a sharper focus on trying new things, a focus on new revenue streams, and an optimism that even in a recession, things will work out well with 32% feeling very confident their business will grow (verses 22% overall).\nThere is clearly something worthy of further investigation and understanding the great leadership and inspiration these businesses are showing.\nThere is no one single, simple digital solution that fits all, so all levers need to be pulled in order to find something that works for each business and maximise opportunities to find a positive way forward.\n“I don’t think that I’ve made cutbacks as such but I haven’t maybe grown as quickly as I would have hoped. Selling overseas is something that I’d really like to do. I stuck to the UK as the Brexit thing made things really difficult. I want to increase my website sales - currently it’s about 10% of my income but would like it to be about 45%.” Kate Tompsett Owner and Director, Happy & Glorious “I bought my first computer last year. I call myself ‘Billy 2 fingers’. I’ve learned a lot and everything is going the right way. I’ve never had an email address before and now I have 2 but am learning more and more on a daily basis. Just waiting for the Internet to be put into my house so I get up at 8 each day to use a community centre space where there’s nice coffee, internet and cake!” Nick Avery Owner and Designer, Pawfect Bags Small Business: Moving Forward 2023 | Driving Growth | 37 1. Use Social Media Platforms to Reach Customers Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are great tools to connect with potential customers. It’s important to develop a social media strategy that aligns with your business goals and target audience. One of the key benefits of social media is that it allows you to create engaging content that can be shared with your followers. Engaging with your followers and responding to their comments and questions can also help build a loyal customer base.\n2. Build or join a Referral Program A referral program is a powerful growth hack for small businesses. By incentivising your customers to refer their friends and family, you can tap into a powerful network effect. Referral programs can be as simple as offering a discount or reward for every new customer that a current customer refers. This can be an effective way to acquire new customers and build brand awareness.\n3. Monitor your online reputation Your online reputation can make or break your business. Monitor your brand’s online presence regularly, including social media, review sites, and forums. Respond promptly and professionally to negative reviews or feedback, and use positive feedback to build social proof for your business. Consider using a reputation management tool like Google Alerts or Mention to monitor your brand mentions online.\n4. Implement Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the process of optimising your website and content to rank higher in search engine results pages. By improving your website’s ranking for relevant search terms, you can increase the visibility of your business and attract more organic traffic to your website. Implementing SEO best practices, such as keyword research, on-page optimisation, and link building, can help improve your website’s ranking and drive more traffic to your website.\n5. Utilise Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing is the process of partnering with individuals or businesses with a large following on social media to promote your products or services. By leveraging the audience of influencers, you can reach a larger audience and build brand awareness. It’s important to identify influencers that align with your business values and target audience, and to develop a clear partnership agreement that outlines expectations and deliverables.\n“I’m feeling quite optimistic - this specific term has been a bit of a disappointment, one of my classes had to be dropped but it gave me a chance to breathe and there’s some really exciting things on the horizon for me. Teaching and speaking within the world of modern quilting, it’s going to be good. Don’t ever say no - say yes and then work out how you’ll do it.” Sheena Roberts Founder, Green Man Quilts “The average order value was down and we had to spend a lot more money on online advertising. We are still hoping to grow this year and are cautiously optimistic about increasing awareness of our brand and attracting other small businesses to our platform.” Rachel Marshall Owner, Uniquely Local With this in mind, we asked Dr Tom Williamson, Assistant Principal of ARU Peterborough University, for his Growth Hacks for Small Business. “As a small business, the use of digital tools and platforms can be game changing to help you reach and engage with new customers. However, it can also be a minefield of terminology, rapidly take up a lot of precious time, and doesn’t always yield instant results. Here are my five top tips for using digital tools to grow your small business.” In conclusion, leveraging digital tools and the internet is essential for small businesses looking to grow in today’s digital age. By utilising email marketing, investing in SEO, using social media advertising, collaborating with influencers, and monitoring your online reputation, you can take your business to the next level and reach new levels of success.
